<h3>Hi, my name is Khen Aldrich C. Quezon</h3>

     <p> I'm 18 years old and currently living in my aunt's house at Labangon Optima,
          being able to go to college is already a big blessing for me, but deciding what
          course I should take was one of the challenging parts of going to college.
          Because most of my family asks me, "Why did you choose the course BSIT?"
          it hits me every time. They question me about my course, and my answer is
          always "no choice" or "hilig man kos computer." but deep inside,
          I have my own reason that I can't even comprehend because of the pressure
          in the family and to other people. This course was my second opinion;
          next to psychology, IT is the only course that my family approved,
           but due to financial reasons, deep inside, I really want to pursue this
          course because I can see myself as a developer in the future, and I know
          this course will challenge my critical thinking skills, patience, and many 
          more to uncover. I promise to myself and to my family that I will do 
          everything that I can to finish my academics, because I want to repay all
          the kindness and love that they have given to me. I know reaching my goals 
          is not as easy as dreaming of it, but all in all I will do my very best to
          reach the end of this chapter, proud of what I will achieve.</p>

     <p>Dreaming of something big is not easy, not because it feels impossible to
          accomplish, but because it is the one that I really want in my life, and the 
          feeling that you're failing your parents and yourself is one of the scariest
          things that can happen to me. Thankfully I have someone that inspires me to
          do my very best in school and to be a better version of myself than
          I was yesterday. Because of that person, I realize that I needed to change
          for the better and also for the future that I seek. Failing is scary,
          but failing while not being in your full potential is more disappointing;
          that is why changing oneself is the best way to success. I want to graduate
          from this course not only to make my family proud but also my past self and
          say to myself that "we've come far and achieved great things in life."
          Just imagining that word makes me excited about my future and what comes
          next in my life. The future awaits us, and the present is our guide to what
          comes next....</p>
