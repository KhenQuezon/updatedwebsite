    <h3 style="color: white; font-style: italic;">I know a place<br>
         It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face<br>
         We get married in our heads<br>
         Something to do while we try to recall how we met<br>
         Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
         Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
        Do you think I have forgotten about you?<br>
You and I (don't let go), we're alive (don't let go)<br>
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes<br>
Wait (don't let go) and pretend (don't let go)<br>
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end (in the end)<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten about you?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten?<br>
Do you think I have forgotten about you?<br>
And there was something 'bout you that now I can't remember<br>
It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender<br>
And I miss you on a train, I miss you in the morning<br>
I never know what to think about<br>
I think about you (so don't let go)<br>
About you (so don't let go)<br>
Do you think I have forgotten about you? (Don't let go)<br>
About you<br>
About you<br>
Do you think I have forgotten about you? (Don't let go)</h3>
